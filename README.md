# tabstatistics

A few extensions for showing real-time stats for tab count, tabs opened, tabs closed and tab switches per session.

TODO

* Re-enable storage debounce

* Add popup that shows all stored data
* Rotate between values?
* Select visible badge?
* Tooltip with all values?

* Deterministically tell when session restore has ended, and start tracking tab events then
