# tabstatistics

An extension for showing real-time per-day stats:

- # tab count
- + tabs opened
- - tabs closed
- ~ tab switches


TODO

- W window count
- L loaded tab count
- U unloaded tab count
- D days of history stored

* Re-enable storage debounce

* Add popup that shows all stored data
* Rotate between values?
* Select visible badge?
* Tooltip with all values?

* Deterministically tell when session restore has ended, and start tracking tab events then
